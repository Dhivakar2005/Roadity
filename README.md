# 🚦 Rodity: Road Accident Predictor and Analyzer

## 🔍 Overview

Rodity is a web-based application that leverages machine learning to predict and analyze road accident severity based on various real-world factors. It helps users understand how different conditions affect road safety, enabling proactive measures for accident prevention.

## 🧠 Features

- 🚗 Accident severity prediction using trained machine learning models
- 📊 Interactive visual analysis of accident data
- 🧾 User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- 🔒 Login/signup system to restrict access to prediction tools
- 🤖 Gemini API integration for driving safety suggestions

## 🧾 Input Columns / Features

The model takes the following features as input:

| Column           | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `weather`        | Weather condition during the incident       |
| `road_condition` | Condition of the road                       |
| `road_type`      | Type of road                                |
| `lighting`       | Lighting condition                          |
| `vehicle_type`   | Type of vehicle involved                    |
| `driver_age`     | Age of the driver                           |
| `speed_limit`    | Legal speed limit of the road               |
| `traffic_volume` | Estimated traffic volume on the road        |
| `severity`       | Severity of the accident                    |
